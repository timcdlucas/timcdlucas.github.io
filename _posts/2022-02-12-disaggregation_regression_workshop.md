Disaggregation regression workshop
===========================================


The recording of this workshop is here. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frKbnV5PxH4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frKbnV5PxH4)




I am now running it on both the 31st of March 2022 and the 7th of April 2022. 
Both 3-5pm GMT.
There may be some space left so please email if you are interested.




Do you have areal data (county, LSA, ADMIN2 etc.) but want to make predictions at a higher resolution (5km x 5km raster etc)?
If so disaggregation regression might be for you.

I am running a free 2hr workshop on what disaggregation regression is and how to fit models using the R package disaggregation by Anita Nandi, myself and other contributors. If you would like to attend please just send me an email tim.lucas@leicester.ac.uk. I'll email round a teams link nearer the time.
