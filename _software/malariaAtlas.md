This package allows users to download prevalence surveys, mosquito occurrences, geographic shapefiles and modelled raster surfaces from the Malaria Atlas Project.

Dan Pfeffer wrote most of the code.
Suzanne Keddie wrote mosquito occurrence functionality.
Joe Harris and Daniel May provided a lot of support in connecting to the online databases.
I conceived the project and supervised the work.
