This package allows users to run species distribution models using interchangeable modules.
We tried to make the modules easy to build with the hope that the community would contribute modules so that the package can keep up with this fast moving field.

I wrote the first version of the package during an internship supervised by Nick Golding, Greg McInerny and Emil Van Loon.
Lots more work has been done to the package by those mentioned above and Tom August.

We have published a software paper for this package in. [The zoon R package for reproducible and shareable species distribution modelling](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12858).
