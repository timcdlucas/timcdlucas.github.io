Shinyscholar was conceived and written by Simon Smart while working with me. 
This work was funded by the Wellcome trust.

Shinyscholar is a basic application written in R that can be used as a template to create complex applications that are modular, meet academic standards of attribution and are reproducible outside of the application. By using shinyscholar, to create a template application, developers will be encouraged to produce applications that are maintainable and run reliably without having to learn software development best-practices from scratch. shinyscholar was forked from {wallace} v2.0.5 (CRAN, website) a modular platform for reproducible modelling of species distributions. Specifically, it harnesses the higher-level structure and core attributes of Wallace but removes its discipline-specific features, yielding a generic template for developers to make their own applications. We are very grateful to the contributors to {wallace} and the features retained from it and the new features added in shinyscholar are described in NEWS.
