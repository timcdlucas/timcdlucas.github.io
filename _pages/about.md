I am currently a Senior post-doc in Deirdre Hollingsworths lab at the Big Data Institute, University of Oxford.
Previously I worked with the Malaria Atlas Project.

My interests encompass statistical methods and mathematical models for studying disease.
This has largely been focussed on geospatial methods for disease mapping.
I have a continuing interest in statistical methods for ecology.

I have written a number of R packages which an be found on CRAN or on my [github](www.github.com/timcdlucas)
