I am a lecturer in the [Dept. of Health Sciences](https://le.ac.uk/health-sciences) at the University of Leicester.
Please feel free to email me to discuss stats, modelling, R or anything else.

My interests encompass statistical methods and mathematical models for studying disease.
In particular I'm interested in studying methods that account for multiple temporal or spatial scales.
For example, disease progression or diagnosis is typically quite a slow process, but we are exposed to environmental factors such as air pollution every second.
Depending on our movement patterns, we can have very different exposures from one minute to the next.

I have a continuing interest in infectious disease models and statistical methods for ecology.
Recently this has involved developing models of contact tracing to help guide COVID-19 policy.
Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at Imperial College.
Before that I worked with Deirdre Hollingsworth and the Malaria Atlas Project at the Big Data Institute, University of Oxford on neglected tropical diseases and malaria.


If you are a student looking for opportunities such as masters or PhD projects please email to say hello.
My address is tim.lucas --- at --- le.ac.uk.
Or you can say hello on twitter @timcdlucas and @StatsForBios.
I currently have a (competition funded) [project out to advert](https://le.ac.uk/study/research-degrees/funded-opportunities/future-100-phd-cls); stats and machine learning methods to relate high resolution air pollution data and low resolution health data. 
There are studentships or [pre-doctoral fellowships](https://www.google.com/search?q=nihr+predoctoral+fellowship&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB962GB962&oq=&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) we could develop a project for.
I haven't yet supervised a student through an entire PhD. 
However, my belief is that the primary aim in a PhD is simply to be happy and healthy, now and in the future.
The secondary aim is to graduate.
Gaining skills, doing exciting science and publishing papers are subsidiary to the above.
I want to be a thoroughly supportive supervisor no matter your strengths, weaksnesses and background.
