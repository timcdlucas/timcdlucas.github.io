I am a lecturer in the [Dept. of Population Health Sciences](https://le.ac.uk/health-sciences) at the University of Leicester.
Please feel free to email me to discuss stats, modelling, R, job opportunities or anything else.
My address is tim.lucas --- at --- le.ac.uk.
Or you can say hello on bluesky [@statsforbios.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/statsforbios.bsky.social).

My interests encompass statistical methods and mathematical models for studying disease.
In particular I'm interested in studying methods that account for multiple temporal or spatial scales.
For example, disease progression or diagnosis is typically quite a slow process, but we are exposed to environmental factors such as air pollution every second.
Depending on our movement patterns, we can have very different exposures from one minute to the next.

I have a continuing interest in infectious disease models and statistical methods for ecology.
Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at Imperial College.
Before that I worked with Deirdre Hollingsworth and the Malaria Atlas Project at the Big Data Institute, University of Oxford on neglected tropical diseases and malaria.


Current Vacancies/Opportunities
--------------------------------

If you are a student looking for opportunities such as masters or PhD projects please email to say hello.
There are studentships or [pre-doctoral fellowships](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/academy-programmes/fellowship-programme.htm#one) we could develop a project for.

My belief is that the primary aim in a PhD is simply to be happy and healthy, now and in the future.
The secondary aim is to graduate.
Gaining skills, doing exciting science and publishing papers typically contribute to the above.
I want to be a thoroughly supportive supervisor no matter your strengths, weaknesses and background.



Lab Group

I currently supervise these people in some capacity.
