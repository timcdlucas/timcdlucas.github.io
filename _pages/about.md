I am an MRC ERC fellow at the [Centre for Environment and Health](http://www.environment-health.ac.uk/), Imperial College.
My interests encompass statistical methods and mathematical models for studying disease.
The aim of my fellowship is to develop geospatial methods for disease mapping that properly account for human movement.
You're not just exposed to air pollution at your home, you are also exposed at work and places you visit.
Standard geostatistical models do not account for this fact.
I have a continuing interest in infectious disease workout and statistical methods for ecology.

Previously I worked with Deirdre Hollingsworth at the Big Data Institute, University of Oxford.
Before that I worked with the Malaria Atlas Project.


I have written a number of R packages which can be found on CRAN or on my [github](https://www.github.com/timcdlucas)
