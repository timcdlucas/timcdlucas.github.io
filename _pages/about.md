I am a lecturer in the [Dept. of Health Sciences](https://le.ac.uk/health-sciences) at the University of Leicester.
Please feel free to email me to discuss stats, modelling, R, job opportunities or anything else.
My address is tim.lucas --- at --- le.ac.uk.


My interests encompass statistical methods and mathematical models for studying disease.
In particular I'm interested in studying methods that account for multiple temporal or spatial scales.
For example, disease progression or diagnosis is typically quite a slow process, but we are exposed to environmental factors such as air pollution every second.
Depending on our movement patterns, we can have very different exposures from one minute to the next.

I have a continuing interest in infectious disease models and statistical methods for ecology.
Recently this has involved developing models of contact tracing to help guide COVID-19 policy.
Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at Imperial College.
Before that I worked with Deirdre Hollingsworth and the Malaria Atlas Project at the Big Data Institute, University of Oxford on neglected tropical diseases and malaria.


Current Vacancies/Opportunities
--------------------------------


Two PhD projects I'm supervisor on are [now open for applicants.](
https://le.ac.uk/study/research-degrees/funded-opportunities/wellcome-trust)

[Multi-omic approaches to understand the medium and long-term effects of COVID-19 and identify novel therapeutic opportunities (1st supervisor).](https://le.ac.uk/-/media/uol/docs/study/funded-ops/2023-projects/genomics-wellcome-trust/projectprofiles2023-t146.docx)

[Applying machine learning to find clinical and genetic predictors for radiotherapy side effects (2nd supervisor).](https://le.ac.uk/-/media/uol/docs/study/funded-ops/2023-projects/genomics-wellcome-trust/projectprofiles2023-t154.docx)




If you are a student looking for opportunities such as masters or PhD projects please email to say hello.
Or you can say hello on twitter [@timcdlucas](www.twitter.com/timcdlucas) or [@StatsForBios](www.twitter.com/statsforbios).
There are studentships or [pre-doctoral fellowships](https://www.google.com/search?q=nihr+predoctoral+fellowship&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB962GB962&oq=&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) we could develop a project for.

I haven't yet supervised a student through an entire PhD. 
However, my belief is that the primary aim in a PhD is simply to be happy and healthy, now and in the future.
The secondary aim is to graduate.
Gaining skills, doing exciting science and publishing papers are subsidiary to the above.
I want to be a thoroughly supportive supervisor no matter your strengths, weaknesses and background.
